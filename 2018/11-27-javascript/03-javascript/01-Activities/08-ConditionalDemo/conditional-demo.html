      /* Instructions

    * Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

    * If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"

    * If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"

    * **BONUS:** Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"

    * **HINT:** You will need to use `document.write()` from a few slides back.
